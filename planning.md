I need to figure out if there is a staged planning I can do or if I have to rewrite the entire program.  I would like to avoid rewriting but also I have a lot of ideas to make things better.

- pop container has the ability to read/write a population in multiple formats includeing string
- Each member of the population has a fitness (or is nan if it has not been evaluated yet)

class population(list):
	__init():
		
	readtxt():

	writetxt():
